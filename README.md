# Temporal variation in markers of immune signaling and wound repair in primary human airway epithelial cells following acute vs. repeated woodsmoke condensate exposure

The goal of this study was to understand the effects of acute and repeated exposure to woodsmoke condensate on primary human bronchial airway epithelial cells. This script was generated to support analysis of TEER, LDH, RNAseq, and secreted protein data and associated figures contained within the manuscript:
